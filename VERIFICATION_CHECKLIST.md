DESCRIBE Users;
-- Should show: IsActive, CreatedAt

DESCRIBE Vehicles;
-- Should show: SoldToUserId

-- Check admin user
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Role = 'Admin';
-- Should return 1 row

-- Check statistics
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users) AS TotalUsers,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Vehicles) AS TotalVehicles,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Bids) AS TotalBids,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Watchlists) AS TotalWatchlist;
```
